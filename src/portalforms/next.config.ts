/**
 * The API is served from this app's own origin, by rewriting to harbor.
 *
 * portaladmin does this because its session is a `SameSite=Lax` cookie that a
 * browser will not send cross-site. There is no session here — these pages are
 * public and the code in the URL is the whole permission — so the reasons are
 * different, but they point the same way.
 *
 * A cross-origin API would need harbor's hostname in the page, which means an
 * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` entry per environment and a preflight before
 * every submission. Both are things to get wrong on the one night of the year
 * when several hundred people are trying to apply at once, and getting them
 * wrong looks like a form that silently will not submit.
 *
 * Proxying means the browser only ever talks to `forms.morganhacks.com`. No
 * CORS, no preflight, and harbor is never a hostname anybody has to know.

/*
 * Harbor, not atlas.
 *
 * Every request here is /api/something, and stripping that prefix is harbor's
 * job -- atlas serves /forms, not /api/forms. Pointed straight at atlas every
 * call 404s, which surfaces as a form that says it does not exist and a
 * console that redirects to sign-in forever, with nothing in any log saying
 * why. The old default was atlas, so it could never have worked.

/*
 * API_ORIGIN is set per environment in Vercel, not here.
 *
 * The fallback below is the local one and is only ever right on a laptop. Each
 * Vercel project carries its own value per environment -- production points at
 * production's harbor, preview at staging's -- because the two environments
 * have different hostnames and a shared value would send one of them at the
 * other's database.
 *
 * Read at build time, not at request time: the rewrite is produced when the
 * app is built, so changing the variable in Vercel changes nothing until
 * something rebuilds. Both portals also carry an ignoreCommand that skips the
 * build when nothing in their directory changed, so a redeploy of the same
 * commit is cancelled and keeps serving the previous value. An environment
 * change therefore needs a commit that touches this directory -- which is what
 * this comment is for.
