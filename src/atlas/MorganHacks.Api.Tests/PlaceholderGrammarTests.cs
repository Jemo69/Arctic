/// <remarks>

/// renderer is a C# regex in <c>EmailTemplate.cs</c>; the editor is three
/// JavaScript ones in <c>portaladmin</c>. They disagreed for real, and the
/// shape of the failure is the reason this file exists rather than a comment:
/// the editor accepted a dot and the renderer did not, so <c>{{event.name}}</c>
/// was a placeholder to the menu, the "Unknown" panel and the author — and not
/// one to <see cref="TemplateRenderer.PlaceholdersIn"/>. Being invisible there
/// made it invisible to the campaign's unfillable and coverage checks too, so
/// the only path it could take was all the way out to everybody, as literal
/// braces, with every check reporting green.
/// <para>
/// The direction matters and is worth stating. The renderer must be **at least
/// as permissive** as the editor. Stricter, and anything the editor offers but
/// the renderer cannot see slips out unchecked, which is the bug above.
/// Looser is harmless: a name the editor would never produce is caught,
/// reported unknown, and refused.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Reading the TypeScript rather than restating it is deliberate, and it is the
