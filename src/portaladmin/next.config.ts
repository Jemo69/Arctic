/**
 * The API is served from this app's own origin, by rewriting to harbor.
 *
 * Not a convenience. The session is a cookie with SameSite=Lax, and a browser
 * does not send a Lax cookie on a cross-site fetch — so an admin app on one
 * origin calling an API on another simply cannot authenticate. The usual
 * workaround is SameSite=None, which turns the cookie into something every
 * other site can make the browser send, and gives up the CSRF protection Lax
 * was there for.
 *
 * Proxying instead means the browser only ever talks to one origin. Lax keeps
 * working, the cookie stays host-only, and harbor is never exposed to the page
 * directly.
 *
 * It also keeps the OAuth round trip on one origin: Google redirects back here,
 * not to an Azure hostname a person has never seen.
 */
/*
 * Harbor, not atlas.
 *
 * Every request here is /api/something, and stripping that prefix is harbor's
 * job -- atlas serves /forms, not /api/forms. Pointed straight at atlas every
 * call 404s, which surfaces as a form that says it does not exist and a
 * console that redirects to sign-in forever, with nothing in any log saying
 * why. The old default was atlas, so it could never have worked.
 */
/*
 * API_ORIGIN is set per environment in Vercel, not here.
 *
 * The fallback below is the local one and is only ever right on a laptop. Each
 * Vercel project carries its own value per environment -- production points at
 * production's harbor, preview at staging's -- because the two environments
 * have different hostnames and a shared value would send one of them at the
 * other's database.
 *
 * Read at build time, not at request time: the rewrite is produced when the
 * app is built, so changing the variable in Vercel changes nothing until
 * something rebuilds. Both portals also carry an ignoreCommand that skips the
 * build when nothing in their directory changed, so a redeploy of the same
 * commit is cancelled and keeps serving the previous value. An environment
 * change therefore needs a commit that touches this directory -- which is what
 * this comment is for.

   * outside src/portaladmin, and the two apps end up with a copy of the
