/**
 * What this applicant wrote, under the questions they were asked.
 *
 * The questions are joined on by the API, in the order the published form asks
 * them, with the ones the form no longer publishes last and unlabelled. Both
 * halves are ordinary: a form edited mid-cycle leaves earlier applicants with
 * answers under keys nothing asks for any more, and those are still somebody's
 * words.
 *
 * Every unanswered question is shown rather than skipped. An absence is a fact
 * about this applicant — an optional question they chose not to answer — and a
 * list that dropped it would read as a question nobody was ever asked.
